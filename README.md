# Experis-Academy

Folder "Java Plain"

The "Java Plain" folder contains a series of Java projects completed during the learning experience at Experis Academy. These projects are examples that demonstrate the implementation of basic concepts and structures in the Java language. They include basic applications, algorithms, data structures, programming principles, and case studies, developed without the use of external frameworks or libraries.

Folder "Spring"

The "Spring" folder contains projects developed during the course at Experis Academy, focusing on the use of the Spring framework. These projects include web applications and RESTful APIs built using Spring Boot, which is a rapid application development tool based on the Spring Framework. The examples implement advanced concepts such as entity management, database connection, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and other aspects of Spring-based application development. The main goal of this section is to provide a practical and applied understanding of how to use Spring and its features to build and manage complex Java applications.

Folder "MySql"

The "MySql" folder is a repository of knowledge and practical implementations in the field of relational databases, primarily focused on MySQL. Inside, there are .sql files that reflect my journey through academic study and practical application of key concepts in the world of databases. These SQL files document experiences in creating and manipulating databases, with a particular focus on scenarios relevant to projects developed in Spring. The queries presented here range from implementing basic structures to advanced data management, offering optimized solutions for a variety of development contexts.
